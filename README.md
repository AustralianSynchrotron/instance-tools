instance-tools
==============

The instance tools comprise a collection of tools that are meant to run inside a cloud instance. They help to shutdown an instance, present the user with a welcome screen and more.

The current tools are:
* InstanceMonitor  
A python-based web service that provides functions to change the metadata of the instance or terminate the instance after a specified time.
* WelcomeScreen  
A configurable python-based GUI that allows users to start programs, websites or folders.
